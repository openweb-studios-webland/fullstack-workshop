# Fullstack GraphQL Workshop

Welcome! Today, we're going to learn how to build a fullstack GraphQL app using the Apollo platform. Let's get started! üöÄ

## Setup instructions

Since we have a lot of material to cover, we're going to complete all the exercises within the browser. This ensures that we minimize our time spent on environment setup and maximize our time learning cool stuff about GraphQL.

Here are the accounts you'll need for today:
- [Apollo Engine](https://engine.apollographql.com/)
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

You'll also need to install [Apollo DevTools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm). If you have all 4 of these things, then we're ready to begin!

## Slides

## Survey

Please take the post-workshop survey!! Your honesty is important to helping me improve for next time: https://forms.gle/17ktSPBNo82VwuPFA

## Apollo Server (Day 1)

Welcome to the server portion of the workshop! We will be building a GraphQL server based on the [Movie DB REST API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

### File Structure (in order of importance):
- `server.js`: Where all the magic happens to set up Apollo Server
- `schema.js`: Your GraphQL schema goes here
- `resolvers/`: Write your resolvers for each type in this folder
- `data-sources/`: Your data sources separate out the data fetching logic from your resolvers

### Running on CodeSandbox

1. Click the button above to navigate to the CodeSandbox. Fork it to your account by clicking Fork in the top menu.
2. That's it! CodeSandbox features HMR, a console, and a test runner. It's pretty awesome. üòç If you see an error message, don't worry - it's because we haven't built our server yet.

### Sandboxes

If you get stuck at any time, click the sandbox for the exercise you want and fork it.

### Running locally

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-workshop-server`
2. Then, make a `.env` file with an `ENGINE_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one [here](https://engine.apollographql.com/) by creating your own Engine service.
3. Install the dependencies: `npm i`
4. Start the server: `npm start`. Your server will be running on port 3000. Your GraphQL server is available at `localhost:3000/graphql` and your GraphQL Playground is available at `localhost:3000/graphql`.

## Apollo Client (Day 2)

Welcome to the client portion of the workshop! We will be building a React app that pulls a list of movies, filters them by type, and allows you to favorite them after you've been logged in. The app is backed by Create React App and Apollo Client.

### File Structure (in order of importance):
- `index.js`: Where we set up Apollo Client
- `components/`: All of the React components that you will connect to Apollo
- `data.js`: Seed data powering the components before we switch to GraphQL
- `App.js`: The top-level App component. You won't need to modify this file.
- `index.css`: Some random CSS. You won't need to modify this file.
